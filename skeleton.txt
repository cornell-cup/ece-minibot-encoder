Count the number of pulses in a given time window
	eg in 100ms, we had xx pulses
	
With 200RPM and 64CPR encoder, 1 pulse is in about ~4.5ms.
100RPM -> ~9ms

PID loop should run ~100 times a second -> 10ms per run

Count the time elapsed for a number of pulses
	eg to get 10 pulses, it took xx ms
	
Time between every single pulse
	eg took xx ms between pulses
	
Test motor = pololu 2823
